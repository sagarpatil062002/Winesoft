ok take sale_for_date_range.php for reference how the total sale module used there and apply logic of it in closing_stock_for_date_range.php but there is small logical change in sale_for_date_range.php we entering value in total_sale_qty and according to it Current Stock-Total_sale_qty gives us Closing Balance and in Closing_Stock_for_date_range.php we enter value in Closing Balance and then Current Stock - Closing Balance gives us Total Sale Qty so by applying this logic can you give me the code by keeping all the functionality same
